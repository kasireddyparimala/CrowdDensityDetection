# Crowd Density Detection using YOLOv5
This project detects people in crowd scenes and classifies density as Low, Medium, or High using YOLOv5.

## 🔍 Objective
Detect and count people in video frames, then classify crowd density.

## 📦 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter(Frames extractions)
- YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)
- Roboflow (for annotation)
- Google Colab (training + inference)
- Matplotlib (for graphs)

## 📁 Files Included
- CrowdDensityDetection.ipynb – Colab notebook for training, inference, and analysis
- data.yaml – Dataset configuration
